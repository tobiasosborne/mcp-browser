# MCP Browser Server - An agentic coding experiment in clojure

## What is this thing?
This project is an MCP server written in clojure that exposes some tools to LLMs via MCP. In particular, the tools exposed allow an agent to access URLs via the text-based browsers w3m and lynx. 

## Warning!!!
This was 100% vibe coded using agentic programming via LLMs. I have never coded a project in clojure before, I barely understand the language and the MCP protocol.

I should never have been given the keys to this thing ;)

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! YOU HAVE REALLY BEEN WARNED!

### Usage
You are on your own at the moment, but no doubt I will come back with a vibe coded tutorial. I used gptel and mcp in emacs to use the tool. I hooked it up to gemini and it seemed to work as expected.
